## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
Instagram:
Silent mode with the crescent moon displaying to other accounts.
Background customization
Pinterest:
Pin boards - I find them very useful
Search Algorithm - I like how when you click on one photo and a series of other similar posts appear afterwards
Twitter:
Hashtags - I used this feature many times to find topics of interest
Friends' likes - I found this interesting to see what my friends liked, most if the times I found the posts they liked relatable

App Idea:
An app idea that I've been thinking about a lot is something like an Online Classroom App. Inspiration came from back in 2020. I remeber how my little brother and sister were using WhatsApp and Telegram to communicate with teachers and classmates. We still don't have centrilized learning system at schools and universities. I was in San Francisco at the moment and everyone in the US use Canvas. I was very sad, at the same time inspired to create a software that would help education-wise not only to people of my country but also worldwide. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a challenge walking through the given instructions. For example I coouldn't find the Storyboard file for a long time. Luckily I was able to find it with the help of google search. Other than that everything was accomplishable.
